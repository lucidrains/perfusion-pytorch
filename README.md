## Perfusion - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01644">Key-Locked Rank One Editing</a>. <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/Perfusion/">Project page</a>

Thought the work may be overhyped at first, but it seems to have successfully built upon a (I think) crucial <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05262">memory editing paper</a>! This will be a boon for all types of attention networks.
